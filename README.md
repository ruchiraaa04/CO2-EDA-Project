# CO2 Emissions Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the CO2 emissions dataset from "Our World in Data." The goal is to uncover insights about global CO2 emissions trends, correlations, and patterns.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
- **Description**: The dataset includes CO2 emissions data for various countries, covering multiple metrics like fossil fuel emissions, per capita emissions, and historical contributions.

---

## Objectives
1. Understand trends in global CO2 emissions over time.
2. Analyze CO2 emissions by country, region, and sector.
3. Identify correlations between emissions and other variables like GDP or population.

---

## Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset and perform an initial inspection.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Statistical summary and visualizations (histograms, box plots).
   - Correlation analysis using heatmaps.
   - Regional and temporal trend analysis.
4. **Insights**: Generate actionable insights about CO2 emissions.

## Key Findings
- Example: Countries in region X have the highest per capita emissions.
- Example: CO2 emissions have increased by Y% globally in the last decade.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Analysis: `scipy`
